# Lecture 7: Advanced RDKit

## Introduction

In this lecture, we will dive deeper into RDKit and explore some of its more advanced functionalities. We will cover:

1. **Substructure matching**: how to search for specific molecular substructures.
2. **Maximum common substructure (MCS)**: how to find the largest common substructure between two molecules.
3. **Conformer generation**: how to generate 3D conformers of a molecule.

## Setup

As always, we first need to update our code. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Open VSCode and open the folder where you cloned the `practical-programming-in-chemistry-exercises` repository.
2. Go to the Source Control tab (the one that looks like a branch) and click on the three dots.
3. Click on `Pull, Push`.
4. Click on `Pull` to update your local repository.
5. Copy the exercise notebook to your folder/repository to work on it.

If you cannot pull because you have made changes, copy the changed files into your own repository, revert the changes (arrow pointing left), and then pull.

Aaaand that's it! You're ready to start with this lecture's [exercises](07_exercises.ipynb).

**Happy coding** :star_struck:
